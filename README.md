# vimTrain
This is an open source project that I'm developing with the goal to simulate a train using Java and ode solvers. The ideia is to make the simulation output a variety of relevant data points to support safe decision making in the railway industry, aided by visual feedback of the results.

## Initial Scope

- Customization of railcars, locomotives, couplers, and the path
- Possibility to place sensors - acceleration, couple deflection -, on relevant vehicles
- 2D Visual representation of the train in each of the computed time points
- Full featured mechanical vibrations analysis of each element

## End goal

- Work together instrumented real trains as a digital twin and continuously optimize the operation
- Easy deployment via Eclipse Basyx
- Machine Learning optimized conduction based on input path and end goal
